# T1A2: Georgia's Portfolio Assessment 
- Deployed Website: https://georgiasportfolio.netlify.app
- GitHub Repo: https://github.com/georgiakennedy/feb24-t1w3-bigwebsite 

## PURPOSE
This website serves as a showcase for the skills and abilities I have learnt since starting this bootcamp. Within this portfolio, you will find general information about me such as my skills, interests and professional knowledge in a format that demonstrates my capabilities to potential employers.

## TARGET AUDIENCE
My personal portfolio would ideally reach the screens of potential employers and other developers who would be interested in collaborating on projects or even just to network. 

## FUNCTIONALITY
EASY NAVIGATION:
The Navigation bar contained links to the websites primary pages, including Home, About, Projects, Blogs and Contact. As the user accessed a specific page, the Navigation Bar highlights the user’s current location within the site. 

RESPONSIVE DESIGN:
I wanted to accommodate user experience across a various range of devices including Smartphones, Tablets and Desktops. To do this, I implemented a responsive design by using media query's. I was able to craft each page to seamlessly adapt to different screen sizes including:
- Smartphones (max-width 576px)
- Tablets (Min-width 576px – Max-width 768px)
- Big Tablets (768px – Max-width 992px)
- Desktops (Min-width 992px – Max-width 1200px)
- Large Desktops (Min-width 1200px)

CONSISTENCY AND FUNCTIONAL DESIGN:
One of my goals was to create a website that focused on delivering a seamless experience to users by developing a straight forward website with effortless navigation. Pages were styled in a simple color pallette throughout the whole website to maintain consistency. I selected different shades of purple as I feel purple best represents myself. The reason for sticking with a simple color palette rather than a colour palette with multiple different colours was to prevent an overwhelming display of colours on each page. Title fonts were consistently coloured in one shade of purple, whilst paragraphs were coloured in white as this was the easiest colour to see amongst the websites dark background. Each hover feature remained consistent throughout as I tried to avoid implementing different styles on each hover feature, as a website with too many effects can be overwhelming for some users.
    
## SCREENSHOTS
<img src="/docs/WebsiteHome.png" alt="Website Home Page Image">
HOME PAGE: The home page is the first page you see when you enter into the website. I used a lottie animation rather than a still image to enhance the overall appearance of the page. I chose the laptop animation as I believe it was very fitting for a software developers portfolio. Like all the pages, I used a dark background colour and light text colours to help the writing “pop”. The Navigation menu is positioned right at the top of the page so the user can easily see it and select what page they’d like to explore. The text on the page explains a little bit about who I am and what I do without forcing the user to read a large paragraph as soon as they enter my portfolio. The page also contains a button to easily download my resume. The hover animation on this page are simple and clean; I decided to go with this style to avoid overwhelming a user with complicated animations. At the bottom of the page, users can click on an icon which will take them to my Facebook, Linkedin, GitHub and Instagram. These elements are located on the footer of each page so the user can access them on any page they go into.

ABOUT PAGE: The about page will generally be the second page users will divert into. This page contains more in depth information about who I am and what I’m studying. It also highlights my current professional skillsets. I decided to go with a cartoon image of myself rather than a real image as I felt this best fit the aesthetics of the portfolio. And after researching other professional portfolios, I found that most of them used a cartoon image as well. 

<img src="/docs/WebsiteProjects.png" alt="Website Projects Page Image">
PROJECTS PAGE: The projects page will showcase all my future projects to potential employers. I decided to keep the page simple and the descriptions brief as too many words can look overwhelming to some. Each box contains an image that shows the project, the title of the project and a brief description on what it’s about. At the end of the description, I also included a “View Project” link as user’s eyes will shift to it once they’ve finished reading the description. I have repeated this same box for the other projects on the same page as I like the page to look consistent.

PROJECT 1 PAGE: Once the user clicks on a project, it will take them to a new page that will have more information on the project. At the top of the page, the image on the projects page will be almost see-through with the projects name in a box over the top of it. Making the image slightly see-through will maintain the dark colour theme that is going on throughout the website. The user will then be able to scroll down and read all about the project they have selected. Once user’s are ready to go back to the main website, they can select the “back to projects” link at the top of the page.

<img src="/docs/WebsiteBlog.png" alt="Website Blog Page Image">
<img src="/docs/WebsiteBlogHover.png" alt="Website Blog Hover Image">
BLOG PAGE AND BLUR: The blog page consists of 5 blog posts. Each blog post is displayed with an image that represents what the blog is about. Once the user hovers over the image, the image will blur and darken; I chose this transition as the image is quite large and felt this type of transition will be seen the best by the user than say a border effect. Each box has the date published and read time of the blog in the top right corner and the title of the blog along the bottom. The text was placed on a faded black background to ensure the users can read the writing against the pictures.

<img src="/docs/WebsiteBlog1.png" alt="Website Blog 1 Page Image">
BLOG 1 PAGE: Once the user clicks on a blog, they will be redirected to a page that looks very similar to the individual project pages. This is to ensure consistency is used throughout the site. 

<img src="/docs/WebsiteContact.png" alt="Website Contact Page Image">
CONTACT PAGE: The contact page is simple and only contains necessary information; location, mobile number and email address. My thoughts around the simplicity were that if the contact page was too overwhelming, users will leave without noting my contact details. A button below my email address with “Contact Me” written on it will take the user directly to a new email with my email address listed as the receiver. 

## SITEMAP 
The sitemap shows that the website will start on the home page. From there via the navigation bar, the user can navigate to either the About page, Projects page, Blog page or Contact page. Both the Projects page and the Blog page have subtopics as these are links to seperate pages.

These wireframes assisted me with choosing the colour scheme of the website, and how I can make each page look visually appealing, all whilst maintaining neatness and seamless navigation. I aimed to create a website that wasn't overwhelming for the user to both look at and use. The dark background on each page along with the colour of the titles and paragraphs help the user clearly see all elements of a page. I chose to use the Arial text as it's one of the easiest font's to read and also matched the aesthetic of my page. I aimed to remain consistent in all my buttons, colours and visuals to help improve usability.
